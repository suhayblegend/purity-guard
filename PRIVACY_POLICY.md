# Privacy Policy for Purity Guard Extension

**Last Updated:** November 23, 2025

Thank you for choosing Purity Guard. This extension is designed to help you avoid harmful websites and stay motivated on your journey to digital purity.

**Your privacy is our highest priority.** Purity Guard is built as a **privacy-first application**. We do not collect, store, sell, or track any of your personal data.

---

## 1. Our Core Privacy Principle: Zero Data Collection

Purity Guard is fundamentally different from many other extensions. **We do NOT collect, store, transmit, or sell any of your personal or sensitive information.**

This includes, but is not limited to:
- ❌ Browsing history or website URLs
- ❌ Personal information (names, emails, usernames)
- ❌ Website content you view
- ❌ IP addresses or location data
- ❌ Keyboard or mouse behavior
- ❌ Payment information
- ❌ Search queries or typed text
- ❌ Any other identifying or sensitive data

**We do not track your behavior. We do not send any user data to our servers or third-party servers. We don't even have servers!**

---

## 2. How Your Data is Stored

All data related to Purity Guard is stored in one place: **locally on your computer**. Everything is under your complete control.

### Local Storage (Default)

By default, all your extension settings and data are stored **locally on your device** using your browser's built-in storage API. **We cannot and do not access this information.**

This locally-stored data includes:
- ✅ Your custom blocklist and whitelist
- ✅ Your streak counters and statistics
- ✅ Victory journal entries
- ✅ All extension settings and preferences
- ✅ Sadaqah (charity) pledge amount and payment history
- ✅ Telegram bot token and chat IDs (if you use the accountability feature)

### Chrome Sync (Optional)

If you enable **Chrome Sync** in your browser settings, some extension data may automatically sync across your devices through **Google's Chrome Sync service**. This is entirely controlled by Google, not by us. We have no access to your synced data. You can disable Chrome Sync at any time in your browser settings.

## 3. Feature-Specific Privacy

### 🤝 Accountability Partner via Telegram (Optional)

Purity Guard offers an **optional** accountability partner feature using Telegram. Here's how it works:

1. **You create your own bot** using @BotFather on Telegram
2. **You provide your bot token** in the extension settings (stored locally on your device)
3. **You add your partner's Telegram Chat ID** (also stored locally)
4. Messages are sent **directly from your device** to Telegram's servers using **your own bot**

**Important Privacy Points:**
- ✅ Your bot token is stored **only on your device**
- ✅ We **never see or access** your Telegram messages or bot token
- ✅ Messages go directly from you → Telegram (we're not in the middle)
- ✅ You can disable this feature at any time in settings
- ✅ This feature is **100% optional** – the extension works perfectly without it

### 💰 Sadaqah (Charity) Feature

The Sadaqah accountability feature helps you commit to charity when you visit blocked sites:

- This feature **only provides reminders** and links to external donation pages
- **No payment information is ever collected, stored, or processed** by Purity Guard
- Your donation history (amounts and dates) is stored **only locally** on your device
- We do not handle any financial transactions
- All donation links lead to trusted external charities (LaunchGood, Muslim Aid, etc.)

### 📖 Victory Journal

Your victory journal entries are:
- Stored **only locally** on your device
- Never transmitted to us or any server
- Completely private and under your control
- Can be deleted at any time

## 4. Permissions Explained

Purity Guard requests only the **minimum permissions necessary** to function. Here's why we need each one:

| Permission | Purpose | Privacy Impact |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **tabs** | To read the current tab's URL and redirect you if it matches your blocklist | We never store or transmit URLs |
| **storage** | To save your settings (blocklist, streak, etc.) locally on your device | All data stays on your device |
| **webNavigation** | To detect harmful URLs before the page loads, enabling instant blocking | No data is collected |
| **declarativeNetRequest** | Modern, privacy-safe Chrome API used to block harmful websites at the network level | No browsing data is accessed |
| **alarms** | To run periodic tasks like the 2-minute reflection timer and daily streak updates | No data is collected |
| **notifications** | To show optional reminders and motivational messages | You control this in settings |

**None of these permissions are used to collect, store, or transmit your personal data.**

## 5. Third-Party Services & Analytics

**We do NOT use:**
- ❌ Google Analytics or any analytics service
- ❌ Tracking pixels or beacons
- ❌ Advertising networks
- ❌ Third-party code libraries that track users
- ❌ Cookies
- ❌ Fingerprinting techniques

**The only third-party service:**
